# Welcome

Welcome to the [**Meu Pet Minha Vida**](https://www.meupetminhavida.org/) project!

This is a cool open-source project that's all about making pet adoption awesome! We're building a website to help furry buddies find their "perfect match" humans. And guess what? We've got an awesome team working on an app too! We're super excited about it!

Below, we will present ways to contribute to the project technically. However, like any product, we rely on contributions from various profiles: Developers, Designers, Product Owners, QAs, UXs. It doesn't matter if you're a beginner or not, the project's idea is also to create a learning network. So feel free to introduce yourself on our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/RAnhUJNv2j)!

This is an OpenSource project, but at this moment we are in a creative phase where some requests may be under discussion with our teams on [Discord](https://discord.gg/RAnhUJNv2j). So, during this phase, don't be shy and reach out to us on our Discord Server. You will be very welcome!

# How to report a bug

Whether you find any bugs in the solution, feel free to use the [Issues](https://github.com/features/issues) tool on GitHub itself. We kindly ask that you follow a similar template when reporting the issue:

- Describe the error with as much detail as possible.

We will do our best to identify, reproduce, and forward the issues to the teams responsible for the solution.
